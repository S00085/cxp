|8.| Interoperability | The system should be able to support multiple forms of integration for both internal & partner systems |
|9.| Scalability / Elasticity | AI / ML driven analytics and recommendations (for next best actions to customer service agents) require more resources on demand at different times |
|10.| Fault Tolerance | The Unified customer profile & near real time view of Customer journey are key capabilities in the Customer management platform which need to be highly fault tolerant|
|11.| Security | Security including Authentication, Authorization are important quality attributes especially since the CMP will maintain sensitive customer related information|
|12.| Maintainability  | Maintainability & evolution of the CMP is a important quality attribute since the system is the foundation of the customer centric organization|
